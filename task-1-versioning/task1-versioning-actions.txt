### intro

here is the small application.
- it just exposes one endpoint `/user/:id`
- it expects integer user id
- it returns te user

### task 1

- describe all steps needed for safe migration response type `User(id, name)` to `User(Int id, String firstName, String lastName)`
 	Add 'String lastName' to the constructor argument of type 'User'
	Fix, make modifications to the parts of code where `User(id, name)` conctructor is called and make it use `User(Int id, String firstName, String lastName)` constructor
- suppose the current version of this artifact is `1.5`
- how would you bring versioning to the API?
- what is the next version if artifact should be?
	Next version would be '2.0'. Reason for that is that signature of one of the classes has changed which leads to complitation errors which need to be fixed
### task 2

- describe all steps needed for safe migration response type `User(id, name)` to `User(Int id, String name, List<String> skills)`
	Add 'List<String> skills' to the constructor argument of type 'User'
	Fix, make modifications to the parts of code where `User(id, name)` conctructor is called and make it use `User(Int id, String firstName, List<String> skills)` constructor
- suppose the current version of this artifact is `1.5`
- how would you bring versioning to the API?
- what is the next version if artifact should be?
	Next version would be '2.0'. Reason for that is that signature of one of the classes has changed which leads to complitation errors which need to be fixed
### definition of done
- all steps should be described in plain english
- all meaningful things like versioning, urls, User data types need to be specified
